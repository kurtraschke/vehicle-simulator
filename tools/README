Run this on google_transit.db:

create index idx_shape_pt_loc on shapes(shape_pt_lat, shape_pt_lon);

(otherwise, generate.py will not run in a reasonable period of time)

Full steps to regenerate the data:

python import.py
python fixup.py
python makeEverything.py user@example.com

Copy tools/out/ to api/
Make the Fusion Tables world-readable on docs.google.com (would be nice if there were an API for this)
